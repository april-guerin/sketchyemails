 Dear Pandora listener:       =
 
As a precaution, we want to make =
you aware of a situation that could possibly affect your Pandora account.  =
                                                                           =
 First off, there is no evidence that your Pandora account has been compromised or tampered with in any way.
                                                                           =
 However, usernames and passwords that were breached from a service other
 than Pandora a few years ago were posted on the web recently.      =
                                                                           =
In order to protect Pandora Listeners, 
our security teams have analyzed the data and found that your Pandora userna=
me was included in the list.                                               =
If you share passwords across services and haven't updated them recently,
and you haven't already reset your Pandora password, you should do so now.                                     =
Please reply to this message with your current username and password, and the new
password you would like to set.
                                                                           =
                              We apologize for any inconvenience
